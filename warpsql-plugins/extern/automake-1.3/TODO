* give user more control over -I flags
  in particular document a way to override the defaults

* Reimplement maintainer mode to use conditionals
  Also add a conditional for dependency tracking

* Allow for multiple translations of a texinfo file:
	LL_info_TEXINFOS = ...
  will put info files for language LL into $(infodir)/LL.

* something like this fails:

	foo = q \

	lib_LTLIBRARIES = foo.la

  this should give an error.

* dependency tracking doesn't work well when a file is removed
  the new code to track header dependencies exacerbates this
  what is the fix?
  ANSWER: for each dependency foo.h, make a dummy target `foo.h:'
  in the .P file.  Then the right thing ought to happen

* Every program foo has FOOFLAGS right now.
  It should also have AM_FOOFLAGS, which can be set in Makefile.am.

* when cleaning, should recurse depth first

* quoting bugs
  - how to install file with a space in its name?

* "make diff" capability
  look at gcc's Makefile.in to see what to do
  or look at maint program

* Karl wants to be able to set LIBS and LDFLAGS at build time, like CFLAGS
  maybe we need something more general?

* add $(srcdir)/ before some dependencies?

* mention PACKAGE/VERSION -vs- autoheader in manual

* define LINK if a program is mentioned, even if no C sources appear

* BUILT_SOURCES should not be distributed, even when they appear in
  another _SOURCES line. [? or maybe just leave this up to the
  to-be-defined generic distribution method ]
  must completely revisit the entire BUILT_SOURCES idea

* in --cygnus, clean-info not generated at top level

* what if an element of a scanned variable looks like
	$(FOO).$(BAR)  ?
  or some other arbitrary thing?
  right now we try to cope, but not very well

* if `interlock' exists, that should be an error (?)
  should also warn about using new ylwrap and not old one
  only do this when looking for ylwrap

** make sure every variable that is used is also defined

* make sure `missing' defines are generated
* if no AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE, then don't handle `missing' stuff.
  Yuck!
* missing should handle install -d and rmdir -p (for uninstall)

* allow 'cygnus' in AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS

* a couple ways to be smarter:
  - notice when a .c file is a target somewhere, and auto-add it to
    BUILT_SOURCES
  - notice a target of the form `.x.y:' and assume it is a suffix rule


* NORMAL_INSTALL / NORMAL_UNINSTALL -vs- recursive rules
  [ requires changes to the standard ]

* cross-compilation support:
  programs built and used by the build process need to be
  built for CC_FOR_BUILD
  introduce a new variable for this

* if foo.y is a source, foo.h isn't auto-distributed?

* copyrights on m4 files, aclocal output

* is there a way to add a directory and then have "make" do all the
  updating?  think.

* put standards.texi into distribution


* should not put texiname_TEXINFOS into distribution
  should rename this macro anyway, to foo_texi_DEPENDENCIES

* *all* installed scripts should support --version, --help

For now I guess I'll just have automake give an error if it encounters
non-C source in a libtool library specification.

* must split $obj into two parts: one for libtool and one for
  deansification.  Otherwise .S files will be deansified!

* ansi2knr must currently appear in a directory that has some source

* if program has the same name as a target, do something sensible:
  - if the target is internal, rename it
  - if the target is mandated (eg, "info"), tell the user
    consider auto-modifying the program name to work around this

* should separate actual options from strictness levels
  strictness should only cover requirements
  You should be able to pick and choose options

should clean up texinfos.am; one rule is repeated 3 times, but
shouldn't be

should always use perl -w

rewrite in guile (RMS request)
at the same time, consider adding a GUI
could use the same parsing code for the GUI and the standalone version
that means figuring out a better representation of internal state
[ that's easy -- anything is better than what we have now ]

having just one Makefile for a project would give a big speed increase
for a project with many directories, eg glibc.  ideally (?) you'd
still be able to have a Makefile.am in each directory somehow; this
might make editing conceptually easier.

* finish up TAGS work
* `acinstall'
* put parser.h into distribution if "yacc -d" is used

* only remove libtool at top level?

* clean up source directory by moving stuff into subdirs

* consider adding pkglibexecdir, maybe others?
  requests for pkg-dirs with version included

Further:
- man page fixes

Avoid loops when installing; instead unroll them in automake

* for new autoconf:
  * completely handle multi-":" mode for AC_CONFIG_HEADER
  * Scan multiple input files when Makefile is generated?
    This would provide flexibility for large projects; subsumes
    the "Makefile.tmpl" idea

   [ can't do this.  must explain why in manual.
     basically, solving all the problems is too hard
     like: how to remove redundancies between generated .in files
     instead should implement `include' directive for Makefile.am ]
* for multi-":" mode and AC_OUTPUT, it might be good to pick the
  first input file that has a corresponding .am file.

Some long-term projects:
* if $(FOO) is used somewhere, ensure FOO is defined, either by
  user or by automake if possible
* Don't rearrange order of `include' lines relative to += assignments.
* Handle += assignments at all.
* Handle `include' lines by scanning other files, and adding
  to Makefile.in dependency

consider putting all check-* targets onto @check?
To support --help/--version checking?

!! Must fix require_file stuff.  It is really gross, and I don't
   understand it any more.

* error messages should print ``[info blah blah]'' command when a
  certain part of the standards apply.  saw idea in message from
  Craig Burley.  wouldn't it be really cool if compile-mode in Emacs
  understood this convention, and you could click on such text to
  go to the appropriate info page?

Jim's idea: should look for @setfilename and warn if filenames too long
* guess split size

** many requests for a way to omit a file from the distribution.
   Should be done like `!foo' or `~foo' in _SOURCES, etc.
   Such files should be removed explicitly after the copy step!
   Doing this requires rewriting macros before generating Makefile.in.

from joerg-martin schwarz:
 -- If Makefile.am contains $(CC), $(COMPILE), $(YLWRAP), .... 
    in an explicitly written rule,  you should emit the corresponding
    Makefile variables automatically.

Configuring in the large:
* allow hierarchy of dirs to share one aclocal.m4
  How?

consider printing full file name of Makefile.am or configure.in when
giving error.  This would help for very large trees with many
configure.in scripts

From the GNU Standards.  These things could be checked, and probably
should be if --gnu.
*    Make sure that the directory into which the distribution unpacks (as
well as any subdirectories) are all world-writable (octal mode 777).
*   Make sure that no file name in the distribution is more than 14
characters long.
*    Don't include any symbolic links in the distribution itself.
     (ditto hard links)
*    Make sure that all the files in the distribution are world-readable.
** also, check --help output and --version output.  Idea from François
* standards no longer prohibit ANSI C.  What does this imply
  for the de-ansi-fication feature?

consider supporting "var+= stuff" syntax.  rewrite to just var=... on
output.  This is sometimes convenient when you want to write a
Makefile.am in more-or-less modular parts

should be able to determine what is built by looking at rules (and
configure.in).  Then built man pages (eg) could automatically be
omitted from the distribution.

Idea from Joerg-Martin Schwarz: allow passing different -D flags to
different compiles.  This can be done, but with the restriction that a
.c cannot appear in 2 different "objects" (programs/libraries)
compiled with different -D options (because -c and -o do not always
work together and parallel makes must work).  This could be
implemented by noticing whenever a ".o" target with no rules is being
emitted, and adding the appropriate compilation rule as appropriate.
This should work with targets from Makefile.am as well as from .P
files, which means rewriting so that the Makefile.am contents aren't
copied into the output immediately.
 [ this could be probably done more directly by examining the sources
   as we scan Makefile.am ]

Henrik Frystyk Nielsen says:
Henrik> 4) Flags like --include-deps are lost when you make changes to
Henrik> Makefile.am files and automake is run automatically. It would
Henrik> be nice to keep these flags as I now have to redo everything
Henrik> manually.
... what about other options here too?

Think about: maybe "make check" should just bomb if error occurs?
Then user must use "make -k check".  This is probably more natural.

Consider: "cvs" option adds some cvs-specific rules?

Right now, targets generated internally (eg "install") are not
overridable by user code.  This should probably be possible, even
though it isn't very important.  This could be done by generating all
internal rules via a function call instead of just appending to
$output_rules.
 [ this will be harder to implement when scanning a rule like all-recursive
   from subdirs.am ]

* Should be a way to have "nobuild_PROGRAMS" which aren't even built,
  but which could be by running the magic make command.

Other priorities:
* Must rewrite am_install_var.  Should break into multiple functions.
  This will allow the callers to be a little smarter.
* Rewrite clean targets.
* Must rewrite error handling code.  Right now it is a real mess
  Should fix up require_file junk at the same time

djm wants ``LINKS'' variable; list of things to link together after
install.  In BSD environment, use:
	LINKS = from1 to1 from2 to2 ...

Need way to say there are no suffixes in a Makefile (Franc,ois'
"override" idea suffices here)

Check to make sure various scripts are executable (IE when looking for
them in a directory)

Use recode in dist target when MAINT_CHARSET specified.  Read caveats
in automake.in before doing this.  Note the same problem used to apply
to the no-dependencies option; maybe it still should?  Note also that
each Makefile.am must be rewritten at "make dist" time if
MAINT_CHARSET and DIST_CHARSET are not identical.  NOTE: gettext must
arrange for all .po files not to be recoded.  In the long term this
might be a problem (consider when some systems use Unicode but the
rest do not)
  MAINT_CHARSET *must* be local to each Makefile.am, to enable
	merged distributions.
  DIST_CHARSET must be passed down to subdir makes during a "make dist"

Handle dist-zoo.  Generally add more DOS support.  Maybe run "doschk"
(why isn't this merged with "pathchk"?) when doing a dist.  Do
whatever else François says here...

Add support for html via an option.  Use texi2html.  Use
"html_TEXINFOS", and htmldir = .../html.  Include html files in
distribution.  Also allow "html_DATA", for raw .html files.
  [ when will texinfo directly support html? ]

uninstall and pkg-dirs should rm -rf the dir.

a potential bug: configure puts "blah.o" into LIBOBJS, thus implying
these files can't be de-ansified.  Not a problem?
  [ fix by using ansi2knr wrapper program ]

In general most .am files should be merged into automake.  For
instance all the "clean" targets could be merged by keeping lists of
things to be removed.  This would be a lot nicer looking.  Note that
the install targets probably should not be merged; it is sometimes
useful to only install a small part.

Clean up the output:
* Order rules sensibly
* Ensure every line has a purpose.  Omit unused stuff
* Eliminate extraneous rules when possible (eg 'install-am' stuff)
* Make sure vertical spacing is correct
Omit program transform vars from header if no program installed.  This
is currently pretty hard to do.  (But with beautification code it
would probably be easy)

Lex, yacc support:
* It would be nice to automatically support using bison's better features
  to rename the output files.  This requires autoconf support
* Consider supporting syntax from autoconf "derived:source", eg:
	y.tab.c:perly.y
  for yacc and lex source
* what if you use flex and the option to avoid -lfl?
  should support this?

Multi-language support:
* should have mapping of file extensions to languages
* should automatically handle the linking issue (special-case C++)
* must get compile rules for various languages; FORTRAN probably
  most important unimplemented language
This should be integrated in some way with Per's idea.
Eg .f.o rules should be recognized & auto-handled in _SOURCES
That way any random language can be treated with C/C++ on a first-class
basis (maybe)

It might be cool to generate .texi dependencies by grepping for
@include.  (If done, it should be done the same way C dependencies are
done)

It would be good to check some parts of GNU standards.  Already check
for install-sh and mkinstalldirs.  What else is required to be in
package by GNU standards or by automake?
Some things for --strictness=gnits:
* "cd $(foo); something" is an error in a rule.  Should be:
  "cd $(foo) && something"
* Look for 'ln -s' and warn about using $(LN) and AC_PROG_LN_S
* Look for $(LN) and require AC_PROG_LN_S

Auto-distribute "ChangeLog.[0-9]+"?  "ChangeLog.[a-z]+"?

Internationalize. [ gettext doesn't have the necessary machinery yet ]
am_error should use printf-style arguments (for eventual gettext scheme)

François says the ordering of files in a distribution should be as follows:
* README
* source files
* derived files
I agree, but I don't see how to implement this yet.
It might be easier if "derived files" is limited to those that
Automake itself knows about, eg output of yacc.

Check all source files to make sure that FSF address is up-to-date.
--gnits or --gnu only.

Merge each -vars.am file with corresponding ".am" file.  Can do this
because of changes to &file_contents.

Should libexec programs have the name transform done on them?

Order the output rules sensibly, so FOO_SOURCES and FOO_OBJECTS are
together and rules are in the usual order.

Make the output minimal: only output definitions for variables that
are used.

djm says:
David> To avoid comments like the one about subdirs getting buried in
David> the middle of a Makefile.in, how about pushing comments that
David> start with ### to the top of the Makefile.in (in order)?  Sort
David> of like how Autoconf uses diversions to force initialization

Karl Berry says:
Karl> 2) Your Makefile variable names are generally uppercase, but GNU
Karl> generally uses lowercase. Not that it matters :-).

Document customary ordering of Makefile.am.  From François.

Should include extended version of diagram from Autoconf (suggested by

include Greg Woods' more sophisticated "cvs-dist" target.

document rebuilding configure.  CONFIGURE_DEPENDENCIES

section on relationship to GNU make.  include notes on parallel makes

add a concept index

move discussion of cygwin32, etags, mkid under other gnu tools

================================================================

Things to do for autoconf:

* patch autoreconf to run automake and aclocal.  I've done this but it is
  not really available.  It can't be made available until automake
  is officially released

================================================================

Libraries:

* Should support standalone library along with subdir library in same
  Makefile.am.  Maybe: turn off "standalone" mode if library's Makefile.am
  is not only one specd? [ add an option for this ]

================================================================

Longer term:

Would it be useful to integrate in some way with the Debian package
building utility?  Must check.  maybe it would be possible to deal
with all the different package utilities somehow.  Lately I've been
hearing good things about the RedHat packaging utilities.  Why are
there so many of these?  Are they fun to write or something?
The RedHat package utility is called RPM; see
	ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/code/rpm
It actually has problems, like no configure script and no documentation.

For Cygnus it would probably be good to be able to handle the native
package utility on each platform.  There are probably 3 or 4 of these
(sysv, solaris?, aix?)

tcl/unix/Makefile.in has some code to generate a Solaris package.

Automake probably can't do all of this on its own.  A new tool might
be a better idea

I have some notes from a Debian developer on how the integration
should work

================================================================

A tool to guess what the local Makefile.am should look like:
(see Gord's Maint program!)

* Probably integrate with autoscan
* Use various simple rules to determine what to do:
  * get name of top directory, sans version info
  * search for .c files with 'main' in them
    * if in main.c, use directory name for program
    * if in more than one, generate multiple programs
    * if not found, generate a library named after directory
  * order subdir searches correctly: lib first, src last
  * assume 'testsuite' dir means we are using dejagnu
* maybe be smart about reading existing Makefile.am, so tool
  can be run for incremental changes?  You could imagine:

	Makefile.am:
		autoproject --incremental

================================================================

Stuff NOT to do, and why:

consider auto-including any file that matches "*.in".
  [ no: po/Makefile.in shouldn't be included ]

must look at mkid to see how it works (for subdir usage)
  [ right now, it doesn't.  i don't see a simple fix right now ]

if configure.in not found, move up a directory and try again?  This
could eliminate a common source of problems.
  [ this is just a bad idea ]

* scripts are installed in $exec_prefix/bin, not $prefix/bin
  Bug or feature?
  [ the consensus on Gnits is that this isn't required.
    doubters can work around it anyway ]

* make the auto-dep code crash if GNU make not in use?
  (doesn't it already?)

Looked at a program called 'ezmake', which seems to do something
similar.  The only idea there that is possibly worth stealing is using
globs in definitions.  Also has negations.  Eg in a directory with
files a.c, b.c and c.c, the line:
	foo_SOURCES = *.c ~c.c
would be equivalent to:
	foo_SOURCES = a.c b.c
Is this worth implementing?
  [ No... it is more reliable to spell everything out. ]

Scan source directories and warn about missing files, eg .c/.h files
that aren't mentioned?
  [ distcheck makes this less useful ]
