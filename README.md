CHECK OUT HTTP://WWW.LEAPDB.COM - LeapDB provides consulting services and an amazon AMI hosted MySQL distribution with a column store (WarpSQL) and real incrementally refreshable materialized views (replacing Flexviews).

PROJECT DEPRECATION WARNING:
=================
Shard-Query has some issues working on MySQL 8 and I do not intend to update it to support MySQL 8.
Flexviews has some issues on MariaDB 10.4 and likewise, I do not intend to update it to support MariaDB 10.4+

Consider using vitess for sharding (warning: does not support as much syntax as Shard-Query for scatter-gather queries)

If you would like these tools updated to support newer versions, contact greenlion@gmail.com to discuss *sponsoring* the
work to update the tools.
