DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS flexviews.drop;;
/****f* SQL_API/drop
 * NAME
 *   flexviews.drop - Drop the materialized view table.  
 * SYNOPSIS
 *   flexviews.drop(v_mview_id);
 * FUNCTION
 *   This function drops the table holding the rows for the materialized
 *   view and also the delta table with the view.  Any automatically maintained
 *   child views are also dropped.  
 * DANGER 
 *   The table is dropped as soon as this command is issued.
 * INPUTS
 *   v_mview_id - The materialized view id 
 * RESULT
 *   An error will be generated in the MySQL client if the view can not be dropped .
 * NOTES
 *   The dictionary information is not removed, instead the metadata is updated to reflect the disabled status.
 * SEE ALSO
 *   SQL_API/create, SQL_API/enable, SQL_API/get_id 
 * EXAMPLE
 *  mysql>
 *    call flexviews.drop(flexviews.get_id('test','mv_example'))
