DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS flexviews.refresh_all ;;
/****f* UTIL_API/refresh_all
 * NAME
 *   flexviews.refresh_all - Computes or applies changes or completely refreshes every enabled materialized view, serially.
 * SYNOPSIS
 *   flexviews.refresh(v_mview_id, 
                       v_mode,
                       v_uow_id) 
 * FUNCTION
 *   This is a convenience function...
 *   This function initiates the refresh process for all enabled views.  It operates only on one type of  
 *   view at a time.  That is, if you specify 'COMPLETE', only 'COMPLETE' views will be refreshed. 
 *   Conversely, complete refresh views won't be refreshed if 'COMPUTE' or 'APPLY' is specified. 
 *   
 * INPUTS
 *   This function takes a combination of input parameters:
 *   * v_mview_id - The materialized view identifier
 *   * v_mode     - COMPLETE|COMPUTE|APPLY|BOTH
 *   * v_uow_id   - (MAY BE NULL)
 *		  When a uow_id (transaction id) is provided the mode selected above will operate only on records
 *		  created at or before the given uow_id.  If a NULL value is provided, then the most recent committed 
 *		  transaction id will be used.
 * NOTES
 * v_mode:
 * |html <table border=1 align="center">
 * |html <tr><th bgcolor=#cccccc>v_mode<th bgcolor=#cccccc>explanation</th></tr><tr>             
 * |html </tr><tr><td>COMPLETE</td><td>COMPLETE is used only for COMPLETE refresh materialized view.  The view is refreshed from scratch using a combination of CREATE TABLE, INSERT INTO and RENAME TABLE
 * |html </tr><tr><td>COMPUTE</td><td>COMPUTE is used for INCREMENTAL tables.  It computes the changes since the last refresh but it does not apply them.  Low cost frequent computations can be made while maintaining the transactional consistency of the view at the last refresh point in time.
 * |html </tr><tr><td>APPLY</td><td>APPLY is used to apply any un-applied changes from previous COMPUTE runs
 * |html </tr><tr><td>BOTH</td><td>BOTH executes a COMPUTE followed by an APPLY
 * |html </tr></table>
 * SEE ALSO
 *   flexviews.enable, flexviews.add_table, flexviews.add_expr
 * EXAMPLE
 *   mysql>
 *     set @mv_id = flexviews.get_id('test', 'mv_example');
 *     call flexviews.refresh(@mv_id, 'BOTH', NULL);
 * NOTES
 *   FlexCDC MUST BE RUNNING in order to COMPUTE changes to views!
