DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS flexviews.create;;
/****f* SQL_API/create
 * NAME
 *   flexviews.create - Create a materialized view id for the view.  This is the very first step when creating a new materialized view.
 * SYNOPSIS
 *   flexviews.create(v_schema, v_mview_name, v_refresh_type)
 * FUNCTION
 *   This function creates a materialized view id for a new materialized view.  
 *   The materialized view identifier is stored in LAST_INSERT_ID() and is also accessible
 *   using flexviews.get_id()
 * INPUTS
 *   * v_schema       - The schema (aka database) in which to create the new view
 *   * v_mview_name   - The name of the materialzied view to create
 *   * v_refresh_type - ENUM('INCREMENTAL','COMPLETE')
 * RESULT
 *   An error will be generated in the MySQL client if the skeleton can not be created.
 * NOTES
 *  Every materialized view has a unique identifier assigned to it by this function.  
 *  Almost every other Flexviews function takes a materialized view id (mview_id) as the first parameter.
 *  v_refresh_type:
 *  * COMPLETE - The view is completely replaced with CREATE TABLE .. AS SELECT.  Slow, but works with all SQL.
 *  * INCREMENTAL - Changelogs are used to update the view only based on the rows that changed.  Fast, but only works with a subset of SQL.
 *  Note that this command will not immediately create the table.  It will be created only when the view is ENABLED.
 * SEE ALSO
 *  SQL_API/enable, SQL_API/add_table, SQL_API/add_expr
 * EXAMPLE
 *   mysql>
 *     call flexviews.create('test', 'mv_example', 'INCREMENTAL');
 *     call flexviews.create('test', 'another_example', 'COMPLETE');
